       <p><b><i><u>Paragraph</u></i></b></p>
       <p>Scolding is something common in student life. Being a naughty boy, I am always scolded by my parents.<br /> But one day I was
    severely scolded by my English teacher. She infect teaches well.
    But that day, I could not resist the temptation that an
    adventure of Nancy Drew offered.<br /> While she was teaching, I was completely engrossed in reading that book. Nancy Drew was
    caught in the trap laid by some smugglers and it was then when I felt a light tap on my bent head. The teacher had
    caught me red handed.<br /> She scolded me then and there and insulted me in front of the whole class.<br /> I was embarrassed. My
    cheeks burned being guilty conscious. When the class was over, I went to the teacher to apologize. When she saw that I
    had realized my mistake, she cooled down and then told me in a very kind manner how disheartening it was when she found
    any student not paying attention. I was genuinely sorry and promised to myself never to commit such a mistake again.</p>
